# MastersResearchCode
Although another GitHub repository exists for this project, as soon as work on sensitive data started I stopped posting there. This is a repository that should not contain any possible sensitive information. This repository still needs certain cleaning steps but the code used should all be here in its final state.

The original repository is available at https://github.com/SigmaRichards/C5014ResearchProject, however does not resemble the current state of my code.
